        <p>Hello! My name is Tehya, my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a student at CU Boulder studying Creative Technology and Design. I plan to minor in Computer Science and Art Studio Practices. Growing up I've liked art and math equally, and I was first exposed to coding in middle school when I wrote a program for a robot to run automatically in a VEX competition. In high school, I took coding classes every year, and explored javascript animation, app development, and some of the more algorithmic coding things with Java. It wasn't really a question of <em>if</em> I would do coding in college, more like a question of <em>where?</em> and <em>would I be able to do art as well?</em> My coding teacher in high school told me about CU's Creative Technology and Design program. I plan on doing Web Development as a part of my career, but I also want to continue to implement art into my life.</p>

      <p>In 2020, I started and internship with Anark Corporation doing QA testing for software. This included manual testing, writing test cases, and automated testing. In August 2021, I started college and continued this internship in a more professional manner, with the same tasks, increased responsibilities and more hours. This experience has helped me develop great professional skills, and guide me on my way toward my career goals.</p>

      <p>Creating art and solving problems have always been a hobby of mine, being able to implement that into my career will be great! But what about my other hobbies? I enjoy being outside, as I grew up in Colorado, and the mountains are home. As such, I enjoy all sorts of nice-weather activities like driving, camping, hiking, tennis, and kayaking. I also like film analysis, and love watching movies and picking them apart. Reading also holds a special place in my heart. I love fantasy and science fiction. While those genres are great, my two favorite books are actually historical fiction family dramas centered on women, <em>Pachinko</em> by Min Jin Lee and <em>The Nightingale</em> by Kristin Hannah. <br>

        <p>Part of my reading hobby is following Daniel Greene on youtube. In fact, his love for multiple fantasy series has helped me enjoy fantasy more. This is favorite video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpAaH87yBcQ">Bookshelf Roast by Daniel Greene. </a>
        I'm currently reading <em>The Wheel Of Time</em> because of him.</p>
