      <p>Hello! My name is Tehya, my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a student at CU Boulder studying Creative Technology and Design. I plan to minor in Computer Science and Art Studio Practices. Growing up I've liked art and math equally, and I was first exposed to coding in middle school when I wrote an a program for a robot to run automatically in a VEX competition. In high school, I took coding classes every year, and really explored javascript animation, app development, and some of the more algorithmic coding things with Java. It wasn't really a question of <em>if</em> I would do coding in college, more like a question of <em>where?</em> and <em>would I be able to do art as well?</em> My coding teacher in high school told me about CU's Creative Technology and Design program. I plan on doing Web Development as apart of my career, but I also want to continue to implement art into my life.</p>
      <p>Creating art and solving problems have always been a hobby of mine, being able to implement that into my career will be great! But what about my other hobbies? I enjoy being outside, as I grew up in Colorado, and the mountains are home. As such I enjoy all sorts of nice-weather acrtivities like driving, camping, hiking, tennis, and kayaking. I also like film analysis, and love watching movies and picking them apart. Reading also hold a special place in my heart. I love fantasy and science fiction. While those genres are great, my two favorite books are actually historical fiction family dramas centered on women, <em>Pachinko</em> by Min Jin Lee and <em>The Nightingale</em> by Kristin Hannah. <br>
