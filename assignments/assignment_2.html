    <div class="pLCBox">
    <p><em>Hello!</em> My name is Tehya, my pronouns are she/her/hers.
      I hope to learn more about how to make websites from this class, but specifically, I want to learn how to implement CSS.
      I've had some experience with html and JS, and hope to learn how to make it more useful other than basic JS animation.
      I work in QA, so I look at <strong>a lot</strong> of html and use the ids and classes to build selectors for TypeScript automated testing. </p>
