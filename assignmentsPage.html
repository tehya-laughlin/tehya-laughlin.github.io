            <p>My <a href="https://tehyalaughlinblog.wordpress.com">Design Foundations Work In Progress</a> site holds my documentation for various projects I worked on during the class. This class covered multiple different topics, but stayed with the basic ideas surrounding design, like space, color, content, and the stages of the Ideation process. The final project for this class was to design an app, and use Adobe XD to create an interactive prototype. Adobe XD is great for basic prototypes, but I definitely found that it laking in some user-input areas. I was excited to learn more about Web developemnet from ATLS 2200.</p>

            <p>I took APPM 3170 in the Fall of 2021. This class was about Discrete Mathematics, and we did a project using statistics and Graph theory to model the growth of an infectious disease
              in different settings and with two different types of data collection methods. This project seemed very relevant due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and highlighted the very interesting science that goes on behind disease tracking and statistical transmission. The project was tough and focused on the Graph data structure. My partner and I used MATLAB to write the simulation algorithm SIR. The two collection methods were face-to-face transmission, which was collected by the subjects wearing cameras on their chests as they went about their normal days. The second method was RFID tracking, like what our phones use to track location. The face-to-face tracking is the golden standard, and the project shows that simulating disease based off of this measure is moe accurate.

          <h3 class="hLC2" >CSCI 1300: Command Line RPG Dungeon Game</h3>
          <p>The final project for my first college coding class was to create a game that played through the terminal with the command line. The goal was to create the game and print a map and menu to the terminal, then take user input to move
          a character around the printed map. We were given the coded Map class, but then everything else about the game we had to create ourselves. We were allowed to work with parnters. Immediately after learning about the project, Joanna Parker and I decided to be partners. We initially had different ideas for the project, but then we decided on an RPG game. The first step was to think about what our project would contain, and how it would function. Then we organized how we would work together collaboratively. Github was important to this project because we could make a private repository and see commits/what the other partner changed. The repository also allowed for a project, with Kanban tabs, and cards that could be moved between tabs, which helped us keep on track since it was a dynamic to-do list. </p>

            <p>IMAGE 2100 is an ATLAS class that focuses on various ways to capture and present visual mediums and topics with a camera. This project had us working in groups to build a VR world in a-frame through Glitch. We build a Celestial Garden, of planets and conical formations. This documentation video shows the world in Augmented Reality, thanks to the ATLAS building's BlackBox Theater.</p>
