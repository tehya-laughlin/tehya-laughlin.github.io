  ### Assignment Two: Hello Me  
  *Hello!* My name is Tehya, my pronouns are she/her/hers. I hope to learn more about how to make websites from this class, but specifically, I want to learn how to implement CSS.I've had some experience with html and JS, and hope to learn how to make it more useful other than basic JS animation.I work in QA, so I look at **a lot** of html and use the ids and classes to build selectors for TypeScript automated testing.
